# resting_FMRI_analysis

How to get started with resting state functional MRI analysis on patients with brain tumours

Designed to be the ideal place to start i.e. straightforward to use, takes advantage of open source software, minimal computational requirements i.e. one can run this quickly with FSL & AFNI on a laptop.

An ideal place to start but all the new code is with ANTS (see ants_tumour_analysis for the newest code)

Does:

Structural image analysis
- brain extraction
- registration (linear)

Functional image analysis
- resting state FMRI pipelines
- ICA (with component viewing, network comparisons, upsampling, and de-noising)

Also makes masks
